It may be the off season but the volunteer work doesn't stop. Since the last round ended, various folks have
- Finalized season points
- Hosted rules committee to consider and incorporate rule proposals
- Worked to find equipment such as new radios, batteries, for next season
- Planned the WMRRA Awards Banquet
- Opened [2022 License Registration](https://www.motorsportreg.com/events/wmrra-2022-licensing-headquarters-519397)
- Released the [2022 Rulebook](/pdfs/rulebook/2022WMRRARuleBook.pdf)
- Planning the 2022 Novice Racer School (NRS) - look for an announcement soon!

While a lot of people volunteer with WMRRA, we could always use more folks to
step up and help out. It takes a lot of people to make our club work. Like
most non-profit organizations: you get what you put in.

To make it easier to know what opportunities exist, one of our volunteer
website maintainers, [Anna Piechowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annapiechowski/) put together a new
[volunteer portal](/volunteer) that advertises some of the 
opportunities that exist to help contribute to our club.

If you think an opportunity was missed, or you have a way you can contribute to the club that isn't listed, reach out to either Cliff (president@wmrra.com), Colt (1stVP@wmrra.com), or Chris (2ndVP@wmrra.com). There is always room for another volunteer.

Chris Wilcox. 2nd VP, WMRRA
