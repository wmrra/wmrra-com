Washington Motorcycle Road Racing Association (WMRRA) has a dedicated racing class and support staff dedicated to helping get new racers onto the racetrack for their very first “timed” racing event, with no previous racing experience required. Our goal is to support interested riders and train them on the basics of motorcycle race-craft and to help facilitate their assimilation into club-racing here in the pacific northwest.  With over 50 years of racing, WMRRA is the premier racing club association!

New members wishing to Race with WMRRA will have to complete 2 components of Novice Racer School (NRS) in order to receive a Novice Race License and be eligible to enter into their first novice race. Those 2 components are: 
1) NRS “In-class Training” 
2) NRS “On-track Training”
