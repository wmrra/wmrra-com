Do you and your friends want to race motorcycles? Washington Motorcycle Road Racing Association (WMRRA) has an entire racing class and support staff dedicated to helping to get riders onto the race track for their very first timed racing event with no previous experience required. Our goal is to find interested riders and train them the basics of motorcycle race-craft and help facilitate their assimilation into the club racing world we have here in the Pacific Northwest.

To start racing with WMRRA new riders will have to complete 2 components of Novice training to be eligible to enter into their first novice race. Those 2 components are the New Racer School (NRS) “In class portion” and the NRS “On track portion”.

The 2025 New Racer School classroom portion will be held in person on Saturday March 1st, 2025 from 9am to 12:00pm at Cascade Tire & Racing Services: [31216 144th Ave SE Unit 120, Kent, WA 98042](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jeWKWktNWxnnBYQt6)

This is the in class portion of the NRS where all of the basic information about the club will be given out. The Class is FREE to all interested persons and it is highly encouraged that you come to this event to help evaluate whether Motorcycle racing is something you would be interested in. 

Things to be covered at this class include:
* Requirements for new riders to complete
* Introduction to motorcycle racecraft following the Ken Hill rubric ([https://substack.com/@kenhill](https://substack.com/@kenhill))
* WMRRA rules and regulations regarding personal safety gear and motorcycle tech inspection requirements
* Novice race class information, and an overview of the day to day schedule
* Relative cost information to getting started into racing

If you're interested in this free course, register HERE: [http://msreg.com/WMRRANRS2025](http://msreg.com/WMRRANRS2025)

This event will help to teach you more about motorcycle racecraft, race starts, passing other riders, and even a practice motorcycle race! This event is the last piece of the puzzle to be able to qualify for your first timed race with WMRRA. 

The on track portion does come with a financial commitment of $329. This purchase buys you a full day of on track riding experience as well as classroom instruction. 20 Minutes of on track riding (during the NRS Exclusive session) and 30 minutes of in class instruction EVERY HOUR from 9AM to 5PM.
