# Taste of Racing
Taste of Racing is a way for you to experience riding in a “racing” environment without committing the time and money towards a race weekend or a track day. We are focusing this towards the ones who want to ride the track, but have not yet committed to racing or attending a track day. This will be a 20 minute controlled session on the track for $20 with experienced control riders. The hidden agenda here is to get you hooked on racing and track riding in general. General riding rules will be discussed during a riders’ meeting before the Taste of Racing session.

> **_NOTE:_** For the 2021 Season ToR may not be allowed to run due to restrictions. Please reach out to registration before the event. Also, reminder that there is no entry fee for 2021 thanks to generous sponsors, so you can come out for free and watch racing.

## General on track guidelines that will be discussed will be as follows:

- No passing lead control rider.
- Entering and exiting track guidelines.
- Passing guidelines: Passing rules will be strictly enforced. Outside passing only. 6 feet of “comfort bubble” will be required. This is “Taste of Racing.” No trophies or monies will be allotted to the fastest rider.
-  Flags: Colors and reasons for each flag such are as 4. follows:
    - Standing Yellow: Caution on track. Be alert of your surroundings and look for flags in all corner stations.
    - Waving Yellow: Caution in upcoming corner. No passing allowed. Proceed at manageable pace.
    - Red Flag: If a Red Flag is waving at any corner station, first thing to do is to raise your left arm to alert following riders that there is a Red Flag and reduce your speed to a slow but steady pace. Your pace should be roughly 2nd gear 3-5k rpm’s, depending on bike/rider. Once reduced to a slow but steady pace, keep left hand raised and proceed to track exit and wait for further instruction.
    - Black Flag: If you see a black flag pointed at your direction, get off of the “racing line,” raise your left hand and slowly reduce speed. Once you have reduced your speed to a slow but steady pace, look over your bike for any obvious leaking fluids. If you see signs of fluid leaks, pull off to the side of the track or completely off the track where possible. If there are no obvious signs of leaking fluids, return to pace and exit the track and wait for further instruction.
    - Checkered Flag: Session is over. Proceed around the track to track exit.
