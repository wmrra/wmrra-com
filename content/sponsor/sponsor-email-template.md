# Sponsorship Email Template

Dear ___________,

I participate as a member of the Washington Motorcycle Road Racing Association. WMRRA is a 501(c)4
not-for-profit organization and relies on membership dues and sponsorship to host race events and
advocate for motorcycle road racing in the Pacific Northwest.

I am taking this time to email you in the hope that you would consider supporting our club. 

You can find a PDF of our prospectus for sponsors and information about sponsorship levels at https://wmrra.com/sponsor/become-a-sponsor/.

Thank you for considering supporting our club.
