You should have a username and password already. If you cannot locate it, check your junk or spam mail folder first. If you cannot locate it, please contact registration@wmrra.com to obtain the information.

Washington state residents are encouraged to purchase a WMRRA season license. All entrants with a valid race license must purchase a WMRRA single event or season license, with the exception of current license holders from OMRRA, AFM or WMRC. Any rider who wishes to reserve a WMRRA race number, must purchase a WMRRA season license. The validity of ANY race license will be determined at the discretion of the Race Director or Referee. License and event fees will be determined by the Executive Board prior to the first round of the season.

### For non-WMMRA members:
You should be able to create an account, but will not be able to register for races until you show proof of a current active racing license. To accomplish this, please complete the first page of the membership/license application only and email, fax, or mail to Registration along with a copy of your current racing license.
