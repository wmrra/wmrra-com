Congratulations on taking the first step on your journey to being a motorcycle
road racer. This is a journey you'll remember forever.

WMRRAâ€™s novice program will give you the experience and skills needed to compete
safely on the racetrack. The New Racer Information Packet will outline all of
the steps, and processes to becoming a Novice. We welcome you to read more,
ask questions, and get involved with our great sport. We hope you choose to
become part of our tight knit family of racers.

Be sure to take photos, videos, and mental snapshots; your novice season
will soon be a blur full of fun, friends, and of course, speed.
Welcome to the WMRRA Family.
