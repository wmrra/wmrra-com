# New Racer Information

WMRRA’s novice program will give you the experience and skills needed to compete
safely on the racetrack. The New Racer Information Packet will outline all of
the steps, and processes to becoming a Novice. At WMRRA you will find a community
of people that will help you achieve your goals and/or dreams of racing… leading
to life long friendships. So we welcome you to read more, ask questions, come check
us out and hopefully get involved with our great sport. We hope you choose to become
part of our tight knit family of racers, we know you won’t be the same if you do.
