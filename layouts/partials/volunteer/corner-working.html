              Absolutely not! No prior corner working or racing experience is necessary. We provide
              a brief orientation session for corner workers each race day and will pair you with an
              experienced volunteer to help you feel comfortable in your new role.

              Corner workers keep riders safe by serving as the primary communication channel between riders and race officials. 
              They also ensure the racing surface is clear and are the first to offer assistance to riders who need help. Their duties include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Radio communication with race control and other race day staff regarding incidents and track conditions.</li>
              <li>Communication to riders with flags about track conditions and safety issues.</li>
              <li>Ensuring the racing surface is clean and free of debris and hazards.</li>
              <li>Assisting riders who have problems.</li>
              <li>Directing riders toward safe racing lines.</li>

              We love to have groups join us! Groups participating as corner workers have an opportunity to receive
              exposure on race day through PA announcements and the opportunity to set up an information booth in the pit.
