    <p>
      Volunteers are the heart and soul of WMRRA. They organize our race events, 
      help keep us safe on track, and do the work behind the scenes to ensure
      we can continue to participate in the sport we love. There are a wide 
      variety of opportunities for all talents and interests - even if you're not a racer!
