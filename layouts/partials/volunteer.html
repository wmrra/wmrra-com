        Volunteers are the heart and soul of WMRRA. They organize our race events, 
        help keep us safe on track, and do the work behind the scenes to ensure
        we can continue to participate in the sport we love. There are a wide 
        variety of opportunities for all talents and interests - even if you're not a racer!

      <p>
        Folks who do all the things on and off the track that keep race events running smoothly and safely.
        <br /> 
        Some jobs require a commitment for a full race day, but many can be performed for only part of
        the day or before/after racing.
